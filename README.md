Django class bases views blog application

# Generic Class-Based Views
The generic class-based-views was introduced to address the common use cases in a Web application, such as creating new objects, form handling, list views, pagination, archive views and so on.
They come in the Django core, and you can implement them from the module django.views.generic.
They are great and can speed up the development process.
